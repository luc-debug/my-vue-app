# My Vue.js Starter Project

This repository contains a simple starter project designed to facilitate my learning journey with Vue.js. Serving as a playground, it doesn't aim for a specific goal or application, but rather offers a space to explore, experiment, and grow my skills in Vue.js.
## What's included?
### Current
üíö Vue.js -  a powerful and flexible JavaScript framework for building user-friendly and reactive single-page applications.

‚ö°Ô∏èvite - a fast and lightweight front-end build tool, utilizing native ES Modules (ESM) for rapid, on-demand serving and efficient hot module replacement during development.

üîó TypeScript - a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript and enhances code safety and maintainability.

### Soon
‚òëÔ∏è ESLint - A linter for JavaScript which means it can detects for example code smells.

üé® Prettier - An opinionated code formatter.

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.0 or higher)
- Yarn (v1.22 or higher)

## Using the Project

After installing the dependencies, you can use the project in two ways:

1. **Development Mode**

    To start the project in development mode, execute the following command:
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```
    The project should now be running at ` http://localhost:5173` and changes to files will automatically update in the browser.

2. **Production Mode**

    ```
    yarn build
    ```
    This command will create an optimized version of your application in the `/dist` folder.
